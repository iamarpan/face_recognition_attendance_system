# Face Recognition Attendance System

During the covid-19 pandemic, we realized the importance of work from home and with this came a problem of tracking people attendance.
Keeping this problem in mind, I have developed a desktop application which will register a user along with his face image. After registering the user, it will train 
a deep neural network. 
During login, the system will capture the image of the user and based on the image, it will identify the user and mark its attendance.
